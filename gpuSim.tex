I NEED A CATCHY NAME FOR MY SIMULATOR. 

XXX is a wildfire simulation library that allows the user to take advantage of the highly-parallel nature of the GPU. The propagation, crowning, and spotting are all implemented both sequentially and as kernels on the GPU using the programming language CUDA \cite{cuda}. 

The GPU is ideally suited to this type of computation because every cell that is propagating must process the same computations as its propagating neighbors.
