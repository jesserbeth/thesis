\section{Overview}
The XXXX library provides functions that allow for a dynamic forest fire simulation to occur. The library is responsible for managing the data provided by input files by a user, calculating spread data, running the sequential or parallel simulation, and writing out the final data to a file for further reading. 

\section{Service Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The functional requirements were created from the behavioral requirements of the library's functionality as used by an outside source. The list of functional requirements may be viewed in Table \ref{tbl:functional_reqs}.

    NR03 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}The library's sequential implementation must be a direct reflection of its\\ parallel implementation. \end{tabular}\\
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}
The non-functional requirements were created based on the internal interactions of the library functions. Data needed to be manipulated and passed among classes and between the host and device for computation purposes. The non-functional requirements are listed in Table \ref{tbl:nonfunctional_reqs}.
  
\section{Use Case Modeling}
\subsection{Overview}
For a better understanding of how the user interacts with the library, this section describes use cases for running a simulation. Both the parallel and sequential functionalities will be shown here.

\subsection{Detailed Use Cases}
\subsubsection{Initialize Simulation Data}
The terrain data encompasses more than the terrain data. The fuel model data must be read from the files, the terrain data, the moisture data, the canopy height data, the crown base height data, and the crown bulk density data. If there is an error with any of these files, the library reports an error. 

\subsubsection{Initialize CPU Data}
The data must be initialized from the input data into a format which is useable by the simulation. This includes calculating the maximum spread rate before the simulation begins. This function must be called whenever there is a change to the data values in the initialize function. 

\subsubsection{Copy To Device}
The data needed for the simulation must be copied from the host to the device (GPU). This must occur every time the data is changed on the CPU side of the library. 

\subsubsection{Propagate}
This occurs when a propagate function is called. This could be from three sources: BD, MT, or IMT. 

\subsubsection{Accelerate}
Once the fire has spread after a time tick, the rate of spread from the fire is accelerated.

\subsubsection{Crowning}
Once the fire has been accelerated, a test is done to see if the fire is crowning. The moment a fire crowns, the torching flag is set for one time tick. The crowning test also checks to see if the fire is passive. If it has progressed to an active fire, the maximum rate of spread is updated to reflect the change. 

\subsubsection{Spotting}
In the event that torching has occurred during the crowning phase, spotting is calculated. A fire brand is launched into the air and it is tested to calculate if any new fires start ahead of the flame wall.

\subsubsection{Copy From Device}
On completion of the desired simulation, the data from the simulation must be copied back from the device back to the host for further processing.
