Forest fire simulation requires an enormous amount of data processing. In order to operate a spread calculation in real-time, it becomes necessary to use parallel processing. Processing the spread calculations on the GPU allows hundreds of calculations to be performed at the same time, which allows the simulator to run up to 20X faster than its sequential counterpart. This forest fire simulation library has the ability to incorporate base fire spread, fire acceleration, crowning, and spotting into the spread simulation. Three different methods for fire spread have been implemented to provide different perspectives to fire researchers.
