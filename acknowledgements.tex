I would like to thank Dr. Fred Harris, Dr. Sergiu Dascalu, and Dr. Eric Wang for being on my committee, with special thanks to Dr. Fred Harris for giving me the opportunity to do research in the HPCVIS lab. I would like to thank Dr. Roger Hoang for providing the original groundwork for this research. I would also like to thank Chase Carthan for his assistance in debugging my project even though he was not directly assigned to it, and his assistance with GDAL. I would also like to thank Thomas Rushton for being my sounding board as I worked on this immense project, and also for making sure I didn't lose my mind. I would like to thank all my other labmates for listening patiently as I bounced ideas off them.
