\section{Overview}
While this work only implements single-GPU simulations, a server with multiple GPU's called the CUBIX box was used to run the timing tests which are presented in this chapter \cite{cubix}. The reason the CUBIX box was used was for the speed of determining results. It allows several simulations to be run and timed simultaneously, which meant the results could be gathered faster. The GPU's used for the performance tests in this work were NVIDIA GTX 970s and the CPUs used was a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.00GHz.
